    <h1>Naming and etymology</h1>
    <p>
      Constantine John Phipps was the first to describe the polar bear as a
      distinct species in 1774 in his report about his 1773 expedition towards
      the North Pole. He chose the scientific name Ursus maritimus, the Latin
      for "maritime bear", due to the animal's native habitat. The Inuit refer
      to the animal as nanook (transliterated as nanuq in the Inupiat language).
      The Yupik also refer to the bear as nanuuk in Siberian Yupik. In the
      Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages of Alyutor and Koryak, the name of the polar
      bear is umqa, while in the related Chukchi, it is umqə. In Russian, it is
      usually called бе́лый медве́дь (bélyj medvédj, 'white bear'), though an
      older word still in use is ошку́й (Oshkúj, which comes from the Komi oski,
      "bear"). In Quebec, the polar bear is referred to by the french terms ours
      blanc ('white bear') or ours polaire ('polar bear'). In Norwegian, one of
      the primary languages of the Svalbard archipelago, the polar bear is
      referred to as isbjørn ('ice bear') or kvitbjørn ('white bear').
    </p>
    <p>
      The polar bear was previously considered to be in its own genus,
      Thalarctos. However, evidence of hybrids between polar bears and brown
      bears, and of the recent evolutionary divergence of the two species, does
      not support the establishment of this separate genus, and the accepted
      scientific name is now therefore Ursus maritimus, as Phipps originally
      proposed.
